### Drone Squadron V3ish

Classes to produce and manage creation, updating, drawing and removal of particles and game objects.

Movement is multiplied by a DeltaTime class to make update independent of frame rate.

The DeltaTime.getOffsetTime() allows shifting the DeltaTime for a more even spread of projectile delays.
